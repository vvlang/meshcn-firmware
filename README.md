## Overview

This repository contains the official device firmware for MESHCN, an open-source LoRa mesh networking project designed for long-range, low-power communication without relying on internet or cellular infrastructure. The firmware supports various hardware platforms, including ESP32, nRF52, RP2040/RP2350, and Linux-based devices.

MESHCN enables text messaging, location sharing, and telemetry over a decentralized mesh network, making it ideal for outdoor adventures, emergency preparedness, and remote operations.
